# SimpleNeuralNetwork
This is my course project where i have implemented a simple Multilayer Neural Network with Sigmoid activation function
and online backpropogation learning algorithm.
The input samples are randomized after each epoch in the backpropogation algorithm.

Input data is read from csv files and network is trained and finally the program outputs the average error energy vs epochs
graph and also the decision boundary of the data after training.
